# Project Status

## Current State
Last Updated: December 2024

### What's Working
- **Lesson 1 Complete**: LiveKit infrastructure fully operational ✅
  - React frontend successfully connects to LiveKit rooms
  - Node.js proxy server handles authentication and room creation
  - WebRTC audio/video connection tested and functional
  - Can join rooms through the React app
  
  - **Security Improvements Implemented**:
  - Removed hardcoded API credentials from setupProxy.js
  - Now loading LiveKit credentials from environment variables
  - Added error handling for missing credentials
  
- **Testing Infrastructure Added**:
  - Created setupProxy.test.js with full test coverage
  - Tests verify token generation and JWT format
  - Mocked LiveKit SDK to avoid ESM compatibility issues
  - Can run tests with `npm test setupProxy.test.js`

- **Lesson 2 In Progress**: S2S Super Agent implementation started
  - Python agent script runs without errors
  - All dependencies installed (despite Python 3.13 compatibility warnings)
  - Agent structure in place with OpenAI VoiceAssistant configuration

### What's Not Working
- **Lesson 2 - Integration Pending**:
  - Haven't tested Python agent connection to LiveKit room yet
  - Need to coordinate running both LiveKit infrastructure and Python agent simultaneously

```

## Key Locations
- Frontend entry: `src/App.js` (start with `npm start`)
- Proxy server: `src/server.js` (runs automatically with frontend?)
- S2S Agent: `agents/super_agent.py` (run with `python super_agent.py`)
- LiveKit credentials: `.env` file (not in Git)

## Dependencies
### Frontend/Server (package.json)
- livekit-client: ^2.13.4
- livekit-server-sdk: ^2.13.0
- react: ^19.1.0
- express: (via react-scripts)
- jest: ^27.5.1 (dev)
- supertest: ^7.1.1 (dev)

### Python Agent (requirements.txt)
```
livekit
livekit-agents
livekit-plugins-openai
livekit-plugins-silero
python-dotenv
```

## Security Notes
- LiveKit API credentials stored in .env file (not in Git)
- Environment variables:
  - LIVEKIT_API_KEY
  - LIVEKIT_API_SECRET
- setupProxy.js now reads from environment, fails gracefully if missing

**Note**: Using Python 3.13 (newer than recommended, may encounter compatibility issues)

## Running the System
To test Lesson 2 integration, need to run simultaneously:

1. **Terminal 1 - Frontend & Proxy**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/[username]/Desktop/coding/voice-agent
   npm start  # or however you start the React app
   ```

2. **Terminal 2 - Python Agent**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/[username]/Desktop/coding/voice-agent/agents
   python super_agent.py
   ```

3. **Browser**: Navigate to localhost:3000 (or configured port)

## Session Notes

### Session 1 (Early June 2025)
- Set up LiveKit account and obtained API credentials
- Created React frontend with LiveKit client SDK
- Implemented Node.js proxy server for secure token generation
- Successfully tested WebRTC connection between browser and LiveKit cloud
- Confirmed can join rooms and establish connections

### Session 2 (Early June 2025)
- Created Python agent structure following S2S Super Agent pattern
- Configured VoiceAssistant with unified OpenAI pipeline (GPT-4o for all components)
- Installed all Python dependencies despite Python 3.13 compatibility warnings
- Agent script runs without import errors
- Next: Test actual connection between Python agent and LiveKit room

### Session 3 (June 14, 2025)
- Secured setupProxy.js by moving credentials to environment variables
- Added comprehensive test suite for token generation
- Resolved CRA testing limitations by mocking LiveKit SDK
- Fixed multiple JSON syntax errors in package.json
- Ready to proceed with Python agent integration testing

## Architecture Notes
Following the Orchestrator Architecture plan from Google Doc:
- Currently implementing Lesson 2: S2S Super Agent with unified OpenAI pipeline
- Using GPT-4o for STT, LLM, and TTS to simulate native speech-to-speech
- Will evolve to multi-agent system with dedicated Orchestrator in Lesson 9
- Each agent will eventually run in Docker container

## Environment Setup
- Python version: 3.13 (newer than typically tested with LiveKit)
- OpenAI API key: Set in .env file
- LiveKit credentials: Set in .env file
- Potential compatibility concern with Python 3.13

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate - Test Lesson 2 Integration**:
   - [ ] Start LiveKit infrastructure (frontend + proxy)
   - [ ] Run Python agent simultaneously
   - [ ] Verify agent appears in LiveKit room
   - [ ] Test voice interaction with the diary coach

2. **Debug if needed**:
   - [ ] Check agent logs for connection errors
   - [ ] Verify environment variables are loaded
   - [ ] Confirm room names match between frontend and agent
   - [ ] Watch for Python 3.13 compatibility issues

3. **Once working**:
   - [ ] Test full conversation flow
   - [ ] Verify low latency with unified OpenAI pipeline
   - [ ] Document any quirks or issues
   - [ ] Move to Lesson 3: Memory implementation

## Debugging Log
### Python 3.13 Compatibility Note
- Using Python 3.13 against recommendation
- If encountering issues, may need to downgrade to Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Watch for async/await behavior changes or library incompatibilities
